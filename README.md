# Tic Tac Toe
 The game of Tic Tac Toe is an interactive program for multiple players. I created it as a project to incorporate HTML with CSS and JavaScript. On a single page you can play the entire game, with two users or one user playing both roles. Players choose which is O and which is X. Each new game starts with a roll of the dice to see who goes first. The game then proceeds normally, ending in either a win or a tie. The game can be stopped and restarted at any time.
 
 Along with the X and O avatars, I added audio files to enhance gameplay, including a dice roll and special sounds for a win or a tie. The screen flashes whenever a player wins. If a user's browser doesn't support the audio, the program informs them of that fact. I used JavaScript functions to generate the random dice roll at the start of play, and to place the avatars on the spaces the user chooses. Another function determines whether any player reaches three in a row, and declares a tie if neither does.
